## Intro

- ğŸ’» Web development is my fascination ğŸš€ and part time work.
- ğŸ’¼ Despite the fact that I studied law at university and worked as a judge's assistant for several years, this experience gave me valuable skills such as punctuality, meticulousness and stress tolerance.
- ğŸš€ Few years ago I started to learn [networking](https://www.credly.com/badges/72883930-5411-44c6-a176-095d591a15d6?source=linked_in_profile) and [web development](https://app.rs.school/certificate/q97ro2jw) and, currently, I take a [RS School frontend course](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/tree/master/stage1).
